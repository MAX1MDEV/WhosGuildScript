# WhosGuildScript
This script makes it easier to create commands and messages (I made it for myself, it's more convenient for me, if you have any problems or ideas, write them in [issues](https://github.com/MAX1MDEV/WhosGuildScript/issues)).
All you need to use the script is to copy the user ID.

### Supported commands/message
| Commands/Message | Text |
| :--------------- | :--- |
| ?warn            | ?warn [ID] You have under 1 hour to wear our guild Tag, failure to do so will result in a termination from the guild and less chance to be accepted again |
| ?kick            | ?Kick [ID] Breaking the guild rules by not wearing the guild tag |
| Hello            | Hello (user)! You all have **3HOURS** to equip the guild tag. If you are having troubles check out https://discord.com/channels/1257491631565967430/1274795918255984651<br>Failure to put on the tag after **3 hours** will result in you being **kicked** from **the Guild.** |
